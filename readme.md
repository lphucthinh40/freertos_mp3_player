# TOUCHSCREEN MP3 PLAYER with FreeRTOS
Building a portable MP3-Player with basic playing modes and volumn controls. This FreeRTOS program runs on SJ-One Board (LPC1958) and uses SPI to communicate with audio decoder (VS1053), touchscreen LCD (ILI9341 & XPT2046), and to read MP3 files from SD Card. The GUI was designed from scratch by loading individual bitmap icons and drawing directly using a modified version of Adafruit-GFX library. I completed this project in 2019 as the final project for CMPE-146. More details will be added soon.
